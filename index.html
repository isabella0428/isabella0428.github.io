                            I adopt FlumeJava as the main development framework and java as main developmemnt language. 
                            Finally I deployed it using Borg system and it is a <span class="emphasis">daily run job</span> in Google. It can process <span class="emphasis">1.4 billion</span> Google account data within <span class="emphasis">20 minutes</span>.

                            Azurite is the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite"> offical recommended</a> local simulator for Azure Storage , which enables both internal developers and external consumers to test their codes locally. I am responsible for the table service part of Azurite.
                            I designed the structure according to the real Azure Storage and simulated the low-level storage part with LokiJS, which is an open source in-memory database.
                            What’s more, I also designed mechanisms to bulk process the data and solve consistency problems. This project has received more than <span class="emphasis">700 stars</span> on GitHub by now.

                     Together with other three students and a Google enginner as our advisor, we create an application following the design of Instagram. We adopt Flutter as frontend developement framework and django as backend development framework.

                     I built a KeyValue store system based on <span class="emphasis">LSM tree</span>, according to the design of <span class="emphasis">LevelDB</span>. I added write-ahead-log for data durability. To further improve the efficiency, I used bloomfilter to speed up the process of looking up keyvalue in each SSTable.
