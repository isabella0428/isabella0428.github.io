                  It was my intern project in Microsoft Shanghai. I was in the
                  Azure Storgae Team in Microsoft Shanghai Office.

                  Testing cost for applications deployed in Azure Storage can be
                  a huge budget for both internal and external developers. To
                  cut down the expenses, many developers are calling for a local
                  Azure Storage emulator. Previously we have Azure Storage
                  Emulator, however it has many limitations. It is
                  single-platform and also requires a lot of dependencies.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  In order to solve current limitations, now we are working on
                  the new emulator which is cross-platform and much easier to
                  configure.

                  local simulator for Azure Storage, which enables both internal
                  developers and external consumers to test their codes locally.
                  I am responsible for the table service part of Azurite. I
                  designed the structure according to the real Azure Storage and
                  simulated the low-level storage part with LokiJS, which is an
                  open source in-memory database. Whatâ€™s more, I also designed
                  mechanisms to bulk process the data and solve consistency
                  problems. This project has received more than
                  <span class="emphasis">700 stars</span> on GitHub by now.
