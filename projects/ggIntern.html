                  It was my intern project in Google Shanghai. I was in the Data
                  Platform Team, under Advertisement Group in Google Shanghai
                  Office.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Due to historical reasons, there exists some trivial data
                  inconsistencies between different Google internal development
                  teams in India, Shanghai and Mountain View. My task is to
                  write a highly distributed pipeline to coordiate the data
                  inconsistency. I adopt
                  <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub35650/">FlumeJava</a>
                  as the main development framework to process the data and java
                  as main developmemnt language. In order to handle the error
                  more gracefully, I also add retrying mechanism and monitoring
                  services. Finally I deployed it using
                  <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>
                  system and it is a
                  <span class="emphasis">daily run job</span> in Google. It can
                  process <span class="emphasis">1.4 billion</span> Google
                  account data within <span class="emphasis">20 minutes</span>.
